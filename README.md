This repository hosts Unity games that I have created from my Unity Course at Duke.
We worked on many other projects, but they all built towards larger projects and these host information that was learned in those projects as well. 

Each has a Mac build and an HTML build.

You can download the repository and run the application labeled "mac_version" or selecting the "html_version" folder and launching the html file into a browser. 

The scripts folder contains scripts used in the game for interactivity and game function.
